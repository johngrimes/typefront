# TypeFront Terms of Service

By using the typefront.com web site or API ("Service"), you are agreeing
to be bound by the following terms and conditions ("Terms of Service").

Small Spark Pty Ltd reserves the right to update and change the Terms of
Service from time to time without notice. Any new features that augment
or enhance the current Service shall be subject to the Terms of Service.
Continued use of the Service after any such changes shall constitute
your consent to such changes. You can review the most current version of
the Terms of Service at any time at:
[http://typefront.com/terms][terms].

Violation of any of the terms below will result in the termination of
your Account. You understand and agree that Small Spark cannot be
responsible for any information or fonts uploaded to the Service. You
agree to use the Service at your own risk.

   permitted.

   requested in order to complete the signup process.

   password. Small Spark cannot and will not be liable for any loss or
   damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.

   jurisdiction (including but not limited to copyright laws).

## Payment, Refunds, Upgrading and Downgrading Terms

1. A valid credit card is required for paying accounts. Free accounts are
   not required to provide a credit card number.

1. If you initially sign up for a Plus, Power or Business account, and
   you don't cancel that account within 30 days, you will be billed
   monthly starting one calendar month after your account was initially
   created. If you cancel prior to the processing of your first invoice,
   you will not be charged.

1. Accounts upgrading from the Free plan to a paying plan are not
   eligible for the 30 day free trial.

1. The Service is billed in advance on a monthly basis and is
   non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months
   of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with
   an open account.

1. All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by
   taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all
   such taxes, levies, or duties, with the exception of Australian GST
   (Goods and Services Tax).

1. For any upgrade or downgrade in plan level, your credit card that you
   provided will automatically be charged the new rate on your next
   billing cycle.

1. Downgrading your Service may cause the loss of font files, features,
   or capacity of your account. Small Spark does not accept any liability
   for such loss.

## Cancellation and Termination

1. You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. An
   email or phone request to cancel your account is not considered
   cancellation. You can cancel your account at any time by clicking on the
   My Account link in the global side bar at the left of the screen. The My
   Account screen provides a simple cancellation link.

1. All of your font files and account information will be immediately
   deleted from the Service upon cancellation. This information can not
   be recovered once your account is cancelled.

1. If you cancel the Service before the end of your current paid up
   month, your cancellation will take effect immediately and you will not
   be charged again.

1. Small Spark, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or
   terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of
   the Service, or any other Small Spark service, for any reason at any
   time. Such termination of the Service will result in the deactivation or
   deletion of your account or your access to your account, and the
   forfeiture and relinquishment of all content, files and information in
   your account. Small Spark reserves the right to refuse service to anyone
   for any reason at any time.
