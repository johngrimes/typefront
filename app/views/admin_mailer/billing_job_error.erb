Hi TypeFront Administrator,

A billing job has failed on <%= $HOST %>.
<%- if @user -%>

The job was being run for the following user, who exists on the system:

<%= render :partial => 'admin_mailer/user_details' %>
<%- else -%>

The user that the job was being run for does not seem to exist on the system at this moment. This could just be a natural effect of a user cancelling their account, and this was the next billing job scheduled to be run.
<%- end -%>

Here is the error:

<%= @error_message %>

Love from TypeFront
