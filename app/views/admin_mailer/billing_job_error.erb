Hi TypeFront Administrator,

A billing job has failed on <%= $HOST %>.
<%- if @user -%>

The job was being run for the following user, who exists on the system:

id: <%= @user.id %>
email: <%= @user.email %>
subscription_level: <%= @user.subscription_level %>
subscription_name: <%= @user.subscription_name %>
subscription_amount: <%= @user.subscription_amount %>
subscription_renewal: <%= @user.subscription_renewal %>
gateway_customer_id: <%= @user.gateway_customer_id %>
card_name: <%= @user.card_name %>
card_type: <%= @user.card_type %>
card_expiry: <%= @user.card_expiry %>
<%- else -%>

The user that the job was being run for does not seem to exist on the system at this moment. This could just be a natural effect of a user cancelling their account, and this was the next billing job scheduled to be run.
<%- end -%>

Here is the error:

<%= @error_message %>

Love from TypeFront
