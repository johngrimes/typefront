Hi TypeFront Administrator,

On <%= $HOST %>, an attempt was made to bill the following user outside of the automatic billing window after the subscription renewal date.

You will need to process any outstanding amounts manually and reset the subscription renewal date.

<%= render :partial => 'admin_mailer/user_details' %>

Love from TypeFront
