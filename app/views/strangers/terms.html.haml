      # TypeFront Terms of Service

      By using the typefront.com web site or API ("Service"), you are agreeing
      to be bound by the following terms and conditions ("Terms of Service").

      Small Spark Pty Ltd reserves the right to update and change the Terms of
      Service from time to time without notice. Any new features that augment
      or enhance the current Service shall be subject to the Terms of Service.
      Continued use of the Service after any such changes shall constitute
      your consent to such changes. You can review the most current version of
      the Terms of Service at any time at:
      [http://typefront.com/terms][terms].

      Violation of any of the terms below will result in the termination of
      your Account. You understand and agree that Small Spark cannot be
      responsible for any information or fonts uploaded to the Service. You
      agree to use the Service at your own risk.

      ## Account terms

      1. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not
         permitted.

      1. You must provide a valid email address, and any other information
         requested in order to complete the signup process.

      1. Your login may only be used by one person or legal entity.

      1. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and
         password. Small Spark cannot and will not be liable for any loss or
         damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.

      1. You must not upload font files to the Service where doing so would
         breach the terms of the font licence.

      1. You must not upload font files to the Service for which you do not
         possess a font licence.

      1. You are responsible for all font files and information uploaded to
         your account, and for any activity that occurs under your account user
         name.

      1. You may not use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.

      1. You must not, in the use of the Service, violate any laws in your
         jurisdiction (including but not limited to copyright laws).

      ## Payment, Refunds, Upgrading and Downgrading Terms

      1. A valid credit card is required for paying accounts. Free accounts are
         not required to provide a credit card number.

      1. If you initially sign up for a Plus, Power or Business account, and
         you don't cancel that account within 30 days, you will be billed
         monthly starting one calendar month after your account was initially
         created. If you cancel prior to the processing of your first invoice,
         you will not be charged.

      1. Accounts upgrading from the Free plan to a paying plan are not
         eligible for the 30 day free trial.

      1. The Service is billed in advance on a monthly basis and is
         non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months
         of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with
         an open account.

      1. All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by
         taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all
         such taxes, levies, or duties, with the exception of Australian GST
         (Goods and Services Tax).

      1. For any upgrade or downgrade in plan level, your credit card that you
         provided will automatically be charged the new rate on your next
         billing cycle.

      1. Downgrading your Service may cause the loss of font files, features,
         or capacity of your account. Small Spark does not accept any liability
         for such loss.

      ## Cancellation and Termination

      1. You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. An
         email or phone request to cancel your account is not considered
         cancellation. You can cancel your account at any time by clicking on the
         My Account link in the global side bar at the left of the screen. The My
         Account screen provides a simple cancellation link.

      1. All of your font files and account information will be immediately
         deleted from the Service upon cancellation. This information can not
         be recovered once your account is cancelled.

      1. If you cancel the Service before the end of your current paid up
         month, your cancellation will take effect immediately and you will not
         be charged again.

      1. Small Spark, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or
         terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of
         the Service, or any other Small Spark service, for any reason at any
         time. Such termination of the Service will result in the deactivation or
         deletion of your account or your access to your account, and the
         forfeiture and relinquishment of all content, files and information in
         your account. Small Spark reserves the right to refuse service to anyone
         for any reason at any time.

      ## Modifications to the Service and Prices

      1. Small Spark reserves the right at any time and from time to time to
         modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any
         part thereof) with or without notice.

      1. Prices of all Services, including but not limited to monthly
         subscription plan fees to the Service, are subject to change upon 30
         days notice from us. Such notice may be provided at any time by posting
         the changes to the TypeFront site (typefront.com) or the Service itself.

      1. Small Spark shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any
         modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the
         Service.

         card details if you sign up for a paying TypeFront account. This is

         the 'remember me' checkbox on the login page.
