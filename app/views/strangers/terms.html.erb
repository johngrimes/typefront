      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Cancellation and Termination</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        You are solely responsible for properly canceling your
        account. An email or phone request to cancel your account is
        not considered cancellation. You can cancel your account at

        All of your font files and account information will be
        immediately deleted from the Service upon cancellation. This
        information can not be recovered once your account is
        cancelled.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you cancel the Service before the end of your current paid
        up month, your cancellation will take effect immediately and
        you will not be charged again.
      </li>
