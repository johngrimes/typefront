      </li>
      <li>
        If you initially sign up for a Plus, Power or Business

        accept any liability for such loss.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Cancellation and Termination</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        You are solely responsible for properly canceling your
        account. An email or phone request to cancel your account is
        not considered cancellation. You can cancel your account at
        any time by clicking on the My Account link in the global side

        a simple cancellation link.
      </li>
      <li>
        All of your font files and account information will be
        immediately deleted from the Service upon cancellation. This
        information can not be recovered once your account is
        cancelled.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you cancel the Service before the end of your current paid
        up month, your cancellation will take effect immediately and
        you will not be charged again.
      </li>
      <li>

        or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or
        future use of the Service, or any other Small Spark service,
        for any reason at any time. Such termination of the Service
        will result in the deactivation or deletion of your account or
        your access to your account, and the forfeiture and
        relinquishment of all content, files and information in your
        account. Small Spark reserves the right to refuse service to
