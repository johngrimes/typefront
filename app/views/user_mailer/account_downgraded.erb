Hi <%= @user.first_name %>,

Due to being unable to process payment for your TypeFront subscription 
using the credit card details you supplied, we have temporarily 
downgraded your account to the Free plan.

You can move back up to a paying subscription simply by visiting the 
following page, and selecting the plan that will suit you best going 
forwards.

Here are the details of the failed payment, for your reference:

---

Amount: A$<%= "%.2f" % @invoice.amount %> (including GST of A$<%= "%.2f" % (@invoice.amount * (1 / 11.to_f)) %>)
Description: <%= @invoice.description %>
Status: Failed
Message: <%= @invoice.error_message %>
