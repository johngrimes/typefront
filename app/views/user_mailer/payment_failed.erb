Hi <%= @user.first_name %>,

<% if @fail_count == 1 -%>
Just letting you know that our attempt to process your most recent 
TypeFront monthly subscription payment failed, with the message 
"<%= @invoice.error_message.split(',').last %>".

Your credit card has not been charged. We will attempt to re-run this 
transaction in another 24 hours from now. In the meantime, please visit 
the following page and update your billing details if necessary:
<% elsif @fail_count > 1 -%>
Our second attempt to process your TypeFront monthly subscription 
payment has failed again, with the message "<%= @invoice.error_message.split(',').last %>". 
  
Please update your details immediately or get into contact with us 
(contact@typefront.com) to avoid any interruption to your service. 

We will attempt to re-run the transaction in another 24 hours, however 
if this fails for a third time we will need to downgrade your 
subscription back to the Free level.

Here is the page where you can update your credit card details:
<% end -%>

<%= account_update_url %>

Please ensure that the credit card details you enter do not belong to an 
expired card, or a regional card not capable of processing international 
transactions.

Here are the details of the failed payment, for your reference:

Amount: A$<%= "%.2f" % @invoice.amount %> (including GST of A$<%= "%.2f" % (@invoice.amount * (1 / 11.to_f)) %>)
Description: <%= @invoice.description %>
Status: Failed
Message: <%= @invoice.error_message %>
